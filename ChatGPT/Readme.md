The language model utilized by ChatGPT is gpt-3.5-turbo, which is one of the most advanced language models developed by OpenAI. Chat models accept a sequence of messages as an input and produce a message generated by the model as an output. Although the chat format is primarily intended for conversations spanning multiple turns, it is also equally useful for single-turn tasks that do not involve any conversations. We used the OpenAI Python library to access the ChatCompletion functionality of the gpt-3.5-turbo model through its API.
